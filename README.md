Problem Statement: - 
Within the context of human resources (HR), attrition is a reduction in the workforce caused by retirement or resignation. This is a serious problem faced by several organizations around the world as attrition is economically damaging to the organizations as the replacement employees have to be hired at a cost and trained again at a cost. High Rates of Attrition also damages the brand value of the company.
Now the Dataset belongs to a very fast-growing company. This company has witnessed several employees leaving the company in the last 3 years. The companyâ€™s HR team has always been reactive to attrition but now the team wants to be proactive and wished to predict attrition of employees using the data they have in hand.
The goal here is to predict whether an employee will leave the company based upon the various variables given in the dataset.

Need of Attrition Dataset: -
1. Anticipation of Employee Attrition:
Supervisors and HR play a crucial role in workforce management, especially when they have insights into employees contemplating leaving the company. This foreknowledge enables proactive measures such as engaging with these employees to encourage them to stay or planning for the recruitment of suitable replacements to maintain a balanced workforce.

2. Seamless Project Pipeline:
Ensuring a continuous and efficient workflow in a project relies on the consistent contribution of all team members. In the event of a key employee deciding to depart unexpectedly, the project's workflow may experience disruptions. Identifying potential attrition allows for preemptive measures to sustain a smooth and uninterrupted project pipeline.

3. Optimized Hiring Practices:
When HR personnel are aware of employees expressing intentions to leave, they can strategically manage hiring processes. This knowledge empowers them to make informed decisions about the timing and quantity of new hires, ensuring that valuable assets are recruited as needed to maintain operational efficiency.
